This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier on two datasets:
Housing Dataset - Used to predict house prices.
Iris Dataset - Used for classifying different species of the Iris flower.
The models are trained using the Gini Impurity criterion to determine the best splits for classification.

Datasets
Housing Dataset: Contains various features related to house prices.
Iris Dataset: Includes four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) to classify iris flower species.

Implementation
The process follows these steps:
Load the datasets.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scaling if necessary).
Train a Decision Tree Classifier using Gini Impurity.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy scores.
Display feature importances.

Results
The trained models provide insights into the most important features affecting predictions.
Visualization of the decision tree and feature importances.
